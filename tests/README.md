## Test Environment

- **Test Runner:** Vitest 4.0.13
- **Testing Library:** @testing-library/react 16.3.0
- **Environment:** jsdom 27.2.0
- **Setup:** @testing-library/jest-dom for additional matchers

## Notes

### Primitive Values
The library's `getSignalValue` function is optimized for object/array mutations using the draft pattern. For primitive values, direct value updates work best:

```javascript
// ✅ Recommended for primitives
$signal.set(10)

// ✅ Recommended for objects
$signal.set((draft) => {
  draft.count = 10
})
```

### Immutability
All tests verify that the original data is never mutated, ensuring proper immutability through the Mutative library.

### Array Operations
Tests cover the correct pattern for removing items from arrays:
```javascript
// ✅ Correct: Use splice in reverse to avoid index shifting
setState((draft) => {
  for (let i = draft.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (condition) draft.splice(i, 1)
  }
})
```
